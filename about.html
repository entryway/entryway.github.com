          <p>Creating software with cutting-edge tools, building out projects, and working with great clients makes my days spin. I have a multi-disciplinary background and a myriad of interests. I left a position as Director of Enterprise Architecture at a large international firm to help form Entryway. The single premise of Entryway is to wield technology in the support of good things both fun and world changing. Working with the team of like-minded folks at Entryway is an added delight.

        <p>I have long dreamt of becoming a rurally based programmer and gardener. Entryway has made this dream a reality. I enjoy Ruby/Rails and striving for best practices. 
          <br/><br/>In my spare time I take great joy from gardening, playing chess, and reading bedtime stories to my son, Gavin. My family and I live in a small homesteading intentional community in Floyd, Virginia, where we are working to build our own home.</p>

        <p>Seeing beauty in the world around me and recreating it, is my mantra (for today). At Entryway my strengths lie in forward-thinking, common-sense design.

      <h3>Core Value</h3>
      <p>Our core value is to use Entryway's considerable talent to build sustainable businesses that are <strong>economically, environmentally, and socially responsible</strong>.  We feel that the quality of our work<strong> </strong>is reflected best in the quality of the organizations we serve. Good projects need nurturing.

      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/greenling-logo.png"/>
      <h3>Greenling</h3>
      <p>Greenling is one of those community benefactors. They want to change the world. Their mission: build sustainable communities by creating a support system for local small farmers, cutting energy expenditures, and delivering high quality organic foods to new customers daily. Not just local foods, <em>organic</em> foods that are herbicide and pesticide free, grown within 100 miles of you, and delivered fresh to your door on a regular basis. Greenling does more than carpool groceries. By helping small farms get their goods to nearby consumers almost the day they are picked, plucked, or pulled from the ground, Greenling supports local economies where <strong>'Small is Beautiful'</strong>. <a href="http://vimeo.com/1448616"> Watch a video about Greenling &gt;&gt;</a></p>

      <h3>Himalayan Institute</h3>
      <p>The Himalayan Institute is another organization changing the world for the better. Founded by Swami Rama of the Himalayas, the Institute is <strong>an established humanitarian center</strong> with world-wide membership, volunteer services, workshops and other educational opportunities designed to &ldquo;discover and embrace the sacred link&mdash;the spirit of human heritage that unites East and West, spirituality and science, and ancient wisdom and modern technology.&rdquo; With an <strong>emphasis on rural empowerment</strong>, the humanitarian works of the Himalayan Institute include building a Community Center in Kumbo, Cameroon, funding schools in India, and sponsoring biodiesel energy farming projects in India and Africa.</p>

      <h3>Family Development Resources Inc.</h3>
      <p>Assessing Parenting, a national parent-child network designed to prevent child abuse, is changing the world for millions of people. The inventory is a diagnostic tool used to assess the risk of unsafe parenting behaviors. With this simple online form family service agents can quickly gauge healthy family dynamics and prevent the maltreatment of children. The inventory is currently available in English and Spanish, though it will ultimately be translated into 37 languages, with Arabic, Creole, Japanese, and Korean currently underway.</p>

      <p  title="closing-content"><b>Economic, environmental,  and social responsibility </b>are vitally important<b>&nbsp;</b>issues at Entryway. It's more than just the businesses we serve, though. We recycle, it's true. But we also use solar powered web hosting, strive for a paperless office, and support local businesses wherever we can. We're more than a company with a green image, we take it home with us.</p>
