          <p> I left a position as Director of Enterprise Architecture at a large international firm to help form Entryway. I have a multi-disciplinary background and a myriad of interests. The single premise of Entryway is to wield technology in the support of good things both fun and world changing. Working with the team of like-minded folks at Entryway is an added delight.
