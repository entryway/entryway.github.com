          <p>Creating software with cutting-edge tools, building out projects, and working with great clients makes my days spin. I have a multi-disciplinary background and a myriad of interests. I left a position as Director of Enterprise Architecture at a large international firm to help form Entryway. The single premise of Entryway is to wield technology in the support of good things both fun and world changing. Working with the team of like-minded folks at Entryway is an added delight.

        <p>I have long dreamt of becoming a rurally based programmer and gardener. Entryway has made this dream a reality. I enjoy Ruby/Rails and striving for best practices. 
          <br/><br/>In my spare time I take great joy from gardening, playing chess, and reading bedtime stories to my son, Gavin. My family and I live in a small homesteading intentional community in Floyd, Virginia, where we are working to build our own home.</p>

        <p>Seeing beauty in the world around me and recreating it, is my mantra (for today). At Entryway my strengths lie in forward-thinking, common-sense design. I enjoy learning about new effective ways to actualize my vision, and move through challenges gracefully.  I am also a stickler for making a plan, but I try not to get too attached.</p>
