          <p>Creating software with cutting-edge tools, building projects, and working with great clients makes my days spin. I have a multi-disciplinary background and a myriad of interests. I left a position as Director of Enterprise Architecture at a large international firm to help form Entryway. The single premise of Entryway is to wield technology in the support of good things both fun and world changing. Working with our team of like-minded folks at Entryway is an added delight.

      <p  title="greenling"><strong>Greenling</strong> is one of those community benefactors. They want to change the world. Their mission: build sustainable communities by creating a support system for local small farmers, cutting energy expenditures, and delivering high quality organic foods to new customers daily. Not just local foods, <em>organic</em> foods that are herbicide and pesticide free, grown within 100 miles of you, and delivered fresh to your door on a regular basis. Greenling does more than carpool groceries. By helping small farms get their goods to nearby consumers almost the day they are picked, plucked, or pulled from the ground, Greenling supports local economies where <strong>'Small is Beautiful'</strong>. <a href="http://vimeo.com/1448616"> Watch a video about Greenling &gt;&gt;</a></p>

With this simple online form family service agents can quickly gauge healthy family dynamics and prevent the maltreatment of children. The inventory is currently available in English and Spanish, though it will ultimately be translated into 37 languages, with Arabic, Creole, Japanese, and Korean currently underway.</p>
