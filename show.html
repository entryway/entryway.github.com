  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <p>To Gustin and others who may read these comments:
  </p>
  <p>It is my absolute pleasure to write some reference notes regarding working with you and the staff at Entryway in creating our new web site:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>1. I am impressed with the knowledge and talent of you and your staff. 
    </li>
    <li>2. You and your staff are current with the newest technology, very methodical in your work, work in controlled stages, plan ahead and work as a team.
      </li>
  <li>3. Creativity is necessary in your job and your team has it. Love the designs you create, offering me different models and different ways of looking at functions.
  </li>
  <li>4. You and your team are meticulous in your work.
  </li>
  <li>5. Pride is another factor. You are your staff take incredible pride in your work.
  </li>
  <li>6. Lastly, I would like to comment on how personable you are. You try in all ways to make sure you are capturing and incorporating my ideas into your design and functions. I have had experiences where I hired a firm to work with me in a creative project only to feel my views are secondary. There are two agendas with firms I have worked with in the past: the firm's agenda where the customer's comments and desires are secondary; and the customer's agenda where the firm trys in every way to create the product that the customer wants. The latter is Entryway. You work for the customer.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Others who read these thoughts hopefully glean from all this that I am 100% pleased with your work, our interactions, and know we will have a continuing working relationship for some time to come. Please know that perspective clients can call or e-mail me if they have specific questions.
  </p>
