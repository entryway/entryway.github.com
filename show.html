  <p  title="greenling"><strong>Greenling</strong> is one of those community benefactors. They want to change the world. Their mission: build sustainable communities by creating a support system for local small farmers, cutting energy expenditures, and delivering high quality organic foods to new customers daily. Not just local foods, <em>organic</em> foods that are herbicide and pesticide free, grown within 100 miles of you, and delivered fresh to your door on a regular basis. Greenling does more than carpool groceries. By helping small farms get their goods to nearby consumers almost the day they are picked, plucked, or pulled from the ground, Greenling supports local economies where <strong>'Small is Beautiful'</strong>. <a href="http://vimeo.com/1448616"> Watch a video about Greenling &gt;&gt;</a></p>

We recycle, it's true. But we also use solar powered web hosting, strive for a paperless office, and support local businesses wherever we can.

  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <p>To Gustin and others who may read these comments:
  </p>
  <p>It is my absolute pleasure to write some reference notes regarding working with you and the staff at Entryway in creating our new web site:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>1. I am impressed with the knowledge and talent of you and your staff. 
    </li>
    <li>2. You and your staff are current with the newest technology, very methodical in your work, work in controlled stages, plan ahead and work as a team.
      </li>
  <li>3. Creativity is necessary in your job and your team has it. Love the designs you create, offering me different models and different ways of looking at functions.
  </li>
  <li>4. You and your team are meticulous in your work.
  </li>
  <li>5. Pride is another factor. You are your staff take incredible pride in your work.
  </li>
  <li>6. Lastly, I would like to comment on how personable you are. You try in all ways to make sure you are capturing and incorporating my ideas into your design and functions. I have had experiences where I hired a firm to work with me in a creative project only to feel my views are secondary. There are two agendas with firms I have worked with in the past: the firm's agenda where the customer's comments and desires are secondary; and the customer's agenda where the firm trys in every way to create the product that the customer wants. The latter is Entryway. You work for the customer.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Others who read these thoughts hopefully glean from all this that I am 100% pleased with your work, our interactions, and know we will have a continuing working relationship for some time to come. Please know that perspective clients can call or e-mail me if they have specific questions.
  </p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br/>
