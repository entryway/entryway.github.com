Pair programming
================

Today it's one month since I left my home in Slovakia to become a real programmer. I've never really worked in a team, or on projects that required more than a few months. My projects were always one or two men show.

During the last month I've been experiencing the environment of a real agile team, with real (good) Ruby on Rails programmers working on real projects. It's definitely most interesting professional experience I've ever had and during last month I might have learned more than in my whole (not so long) Ruby carrier.

The first thing I'd like to tell you about is pair programming. You might have done agile projects. And you might have worked in an agile team. But if you haven't tried pair programming, you're missing something from this whole idea.

Before this I was always soloing projects. The time spent working with someone else was never 'wasted' for actual work, but was wisely used to solve problems. That makes sense, doesn't it? If you can do stuff alone, you should do that. Solving problems is something that's quite difficult to do just alone and that's why we teamed on that. It is economic thinking to not use more people than needed. And that's what I feel like about 37signals' approach - I don't think they pair program, they focus on getting things done without wasting resources.

It all makes sense and it always worked quite well for me. Even I never tried  it I was always excited about idea of pair programming. Although I never felt like I would do that in my own company (imagining I owned one). It would be waste of time/money, right?

So why do successful companies pair program and they are still successful? Aren't they wasting money?

The difference is the quality of code. During the last month it happened to me too many times that I missed something quite important which my programming partner noticed. Having a partner that pays attention to every line of code you write improves its quality much more than test driven development. (You can miss things in tests too.) It also works in the opposite way - when you're the one who's thinking ahead and the other one is typing actual code. It's so much easier for you to notice problems - and much more likely that you will - when you don't have to type code.

In the end, the quality of code is much better than having a few soloers. And when the quality of code is good, there are less errors, less problems, less time spent fixing things and less frustration for everyone.

All these things are good for your business. But if you're owner or manager of a company you probably want to keep your employees motivated - with something else than money - because everyone can offer money.

I'm a great person to tell you about motivation. There are couple of reasons for that. First, I don't care about money. Well, I do, because it's kinda cool to have food to eat, but my point is - I didn't come here to make money. I actually paid more for the ticket and Visa than I made working here so far - so I just don't care about that. Money is not a motivator for me, and that's why I can tell if pair programming motivates you.

I spent here some time soloing one secret project, and some time pair programming on client work. Yes, I feel more motivated to do pair programming, because it's this feeling 'I am not alone here'. The first project I worked here on was a rescue project. The code was really messy, I haven't seen such a messy code in my life. The problem was complexity of application grew and they just forgot about one important step called refactoring.

Now imagine it's monday morning, you come to the office and your task is to do something in that messy code. And you would have to do it, it's your job, you might get fired if you didn't. Now just thinking about that I feel frustrated. If I was supposed to do that alone, I might probably turn around and go back to Europe. Luckily, this company practices pair programming. So when there were two of us it was much easier. The code was awful, but it's like you're not alone.

Yes, you're right, that was just one project, and it was like one or two iterations. Also when you're working with a good code, times of desperation always come, when you're tired and hungry and you have to do something - and that's almost like working on that rescue project. It's just frustration. And that's when pair programming helps a lot.

But pair programming is not always that easy. You have to learn to be patient. You have to make sure both of you are thinking at the same speed, and if you're not, one of you have to wait for the other. When you're working at the same speed, you will think about same ideas and it will become like reading mind, which is really pleasant programming experience.
