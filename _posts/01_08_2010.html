We are dedicated to using a flexible, agile process that is mutually beneficial and transparent. It combines Test-Driven Development, Pair Programming, Short Iterations, and Open Communication, to produce a process has not only improved our quality of work, but it has helped clients prioritize and stay within their budget.

With agile development testing code goes hand in hand with writing code. We use 'cucumber scripts' and 'ajax calls' (well known Ruby testing scripts) to make sure that every line of our code base is solid and successful. Often these test will indicate a problem long before the front-end is effected, allowing us to fix problems before the become 'problems'

Two brains for the price of two brains. By coding together we keep each other focused, efficient, and fast. We also develop cleaner and stronger code, reducing the need for code review and refactoring. We find that in not only aids in our productivity, it also gives us a deeper understanding of our code base.

The days of massive scope and fixed price are over...at Entryway.This doesn't mean we can't tackle a huge application, it just means we take it one step at a time, keeping you informed and updated all along the way. We use Pivotal Tracker to prioritize our feature driven iteration in bite size chunks. This allows us to stay transparent and on budget.

Whether it is a phone call, an email, or a staging site, you will know what's going on. We use User Stories to reduce the 'technical jargon' than can confuse and intimidate clients, so that we can easily communicate about features for the application. We also frequently update a staging site that allows the client to see the visual status of the project.
