"Ppl talk a lot about business value, but they forget that for most people business value is totally subjective! (i.e. unquantifiable)"
http://www.gilb.com/tiki-view_blog.php?blogId=2

<p>
“Something (as a principle or quality) intrinsically valuable or desirable  < sought material values instead of human values” -- W. H. Jones
</p>
<p>
I have a proposition:
</p>

<blockquote>
“Business should exist to server more then their self or customer, they should equally be concerned with society, humanity, and a broader world-view”
</blockquote>

<p>
Your self interests are important, your companies interests are important, your client and customer’s interests are valid. Equally valid is the larger world which your small business relationship is a part of. 
</p>

<h4>Value society as a whole, humanity, domain, over profit </h4>

<p>

The domain that your computer application applies is by virtue an extension of your beliefs and values.
You may put thousands of man hours into a project, if it is some domain or shady area you don’t agree with, it is by virtue you.
In any field this is true.
</p>

<h4>Your values should carry through to your livelihood</h4>

<p>
  While to most this is an obvious statement that does not need repeated, “Of course I want to do good and support the world”.</p>

<p>How often does our livelihood fully support our values?</p>

<p>It is an ideal, something to strive for, of course it is not all roses and we’ve had our share of bumps on the business ride the last 3 years.</p>

<h3>Internet and Technology is currently beoming pervasive</h3>

<h4>Less zombies as predicted of technology and real-world facilitation</h4>

<p>
  The rise of the internet and computer age was heralded by some as a shifting world of bleankness, SnowCrash futures where at the least people would be obsessed and in their own virtual worlds.</p>

<p>
  While certaintly there is always a group of addictive personalities that will over do it, they may not have had a ‘life’ anyway.</p>

<p>
  Overall with the rise of “Social Computing”: twitter, facebook, myspace by the masses, this has not manifested. 
</p>

<h4>Facilitating more efficient real-world events, ideas, and action</h4>

<p>
In fact, more and more one can prove that the online world is supplementing the real world. That lasting, real-world connections are facilitated because of social interaction in the online world.
  </p>

  <h3>Responsiblly harness technology for the future</h3>

  <h4>Ideas we haven't dreamt of yet</h4>

  <p>The nature of society is being changed by technology in ways undefined and evolving.</p>

  <h4>Altering the nature of food distribution, parental assessments, and real-world action</h4>

  <p>Already there are strong online presences that are starting to change the very fabric of their domains. </p>

  <p>These are new blogging software, you tube  , although those impact the real world, these are systems that have direct impact on our nature. Systems that are altering the nature of food distribution, the assessmetn of parental patterns, and .</p>

  <p>These are not mega-lopic big business or research houses that have been using technogogy for 60 years to effectively alter their domains, these are relativel smaller (one could argue focused) business changing the world.</p>








<p>

<p>
   With 15 years experience in the field, I've been involved in a varied amount of domains. Often I grappled with the work I did, while extremely challenging and internesting the real world beneifts were not fully realized. With the relatively recent explosion of the web, the real world benefits of techninology has become apparent. The web is not creating isolated but helping to facilitate real-world interactions and optimze.

 <p>
   It all isn't roses, but ideals are there for motivation, a drivign force.
