          <p><strong>Assessing Parenting</strong></p>
          <blockquote>I would like to comment on how personable you are. You try in all ways to make sure you are capturing and incorporating my ideas into your design and functions. I have had experiences where I hired a firm to work with me in a creative project only to feel my views are secondary. There are two agendas with firms I have worked with in the past: the firm's agenda where the customer's comments and desires are secondary; and the customer's agenda where the firm trys in every way to create the product that the customer wants. The latter is Entryway. You work for the customer.
