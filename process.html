          <p>Whom It May Concern,</p>
          <p>Entryway has been the best web development company I’ve ever worked with or even
          heard about. I own a company that is completely web-based, so our development is the
          center of what we do. I’ve had some really bad experiences with developers and worked
          with 4 different companies before finding Entryway.
          </p>
          <div class="expandable">
          <p>Once I started to get to know the process better for finding a good developer I spent much more time on the front end getting to know the developers and their experience. Anyone
          can put together a quote, but delivering on a quote is a completely different story. I
          interviewed many developers and was most impressed with Gustin’s knowledge and
          experience and depth of understanding of our particular situation. Then he and his team
          executed our plans with incredible efficiency and skill.
          </p>
          <p>
          Entryway has been wonderful at helping us not only execute our ideas, but guide us in the
          decision-making process and prioritizing projects. They have also been a wealth of
          knowledge on the latest technologies and tools we could implement. I think it’s important
          to have a development team that tries to stay on the front edge of technology
          development and the experience to evaluate and implement new tools as they become
          available.

         <p>To Gustin and others who may read these comments:
         <br/>
         It is my absolute pleasure to write some reference notes regarding working with you and the staff at Entryway in creating our new web site:
         </p>
         <div class="expandable">
         <ul class="bavolek">
           <li>1. I am impressed with the knowledge and talent of you and your staff. 
           </li>
           <li>2. You and your staff are current with the newest technology, very methodical in your work, work in controlled stages, plan ahead and work as a team.
             </li>
         <li>3. Creativity is necessary in your job and your team has it. Love the designs you create, offering me different models and different ways of looking at functions.
         </li>
         <li>4. You and your team are meticulous in your work.
         </li>
         <li>5. Pride is another factor. You are your staff take incredible pride in your work.
         </li>
         <li>6. Lastly, I would like to comment on how personable you are. You try in all ways to make sure you are capturing and incorporating my ideas into your design and functions. I have had experiences where I hired a firm to work with me in a creative project only to feel my views are secondary. There are two agendas with firms I have worked with in the past: the firm's agenda where the customer's comments and desires are secondary; and the customer's agenda where the firm trys in every way to create the product that the customer wants. The latter is Entryway. You work for the customer.
         </li>
         </ul>
         <p>Others who read these thoughts hopefully glean from all this that I am 100% pleased with your work, our interactions, and know we will have a continuing working relationship for some time to come. Please know that perspective clients can call or e-mail me if they have specific questions.
         </p>
         <p>Sincerely,<br/>

      <h3>Agile Process</h3>
      <p><strong>We are dedicated to using a flexible, agile process</strong> that is mutually beneficial and transparent. It combines Test-Driven Development, Pair Programming, Short Iterations, and Open Communication, to produce a process has not only improved our quality of work, but it has helped clients prioritize and stay within their budget.</p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-security.png"/>
      <h3>Test-Driven Development</h3>
      <p><strong>With agile development testing code goes hand in hand with writing code.</strong> We use 'cucumber scripts' and 'ajax calls' (well known Ruby testing scripts) to make sure that every line of our code base is solid and successful.  Often these test will indicate a problem long before the front-end is effected, allowing us to fix problems before the become 'problems'</p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-comments.png"/>
      <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
      <p><strong>Two brains for the price of two brains.</strong>  By coding together we keep each other focused, efficient, and fast.  We also develop cleaner and stronger code, reducing the need for code review and refactoring.  We find that in not only aids in our productivity, it also gives us a deeper understanding of our code base.</p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-red_button.png"/>
      <h3>Short Iterations</h3>
      <p><strong> The days of massive scope and fixed price are over...at Entryway.</strong>This doesn't mean we can't tackle a huge application, it just means we take it one step at a time, keeping you informed and updated all along the way.  We use Pivotal Tracker to prioritize our feature driven iteration in bite size chunks.  This allows us to stay transparent and on budget. </p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-new_mail.png"/>
      <h3>Open Communication</h3>
      <!-- content photo -->
      <p><strong>Whether it is a phone call, an email, or a staging site, you will know what's going on.</strong> We use User Stories to reduce the 'technical jargon' than can confuse and intimidate clients, so that we can easily communicate about features for the application. We also frequently update a staging site that allows the client to see the visual status of the project.</p>
