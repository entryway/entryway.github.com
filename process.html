          <p>Entryway has been the best web development company I’ve ever worked with or even
          heard about. I own a company that is completely web-based, so our development is the
          center of what we do. I’ve had some really bad experiences with developers and worked
          with 4 different companies before finding Entryway.
          </p>
          <div class="expandable">
          <p>Once I started to get to know the process better for finding a good developer I spent much more time on the front end getting to know the developers and their experience. Anyone
          can put together a quote, but delivering on a quote is a completely different story. I
          interviewed many developers and was most impressed with Gustin’s knowledge and
          experience and depth of understanding of our particular situation. Then he and his team
          executed our plans with incredible efficiency and skill.
          <br/><br/>
          Entryway has been wonderful at helping us not only execute our ideas, but guide us in the
          decision-making process and prioritizing projects. They have also been a wealth of
          knowledge on the latest technologies and tools we could implement. I think it’s important
          to have a development team that tries to stay on the front edge of technology
          development and the experience to evaluate and implement new tools as they become
          available.

        <h4>Dr. Stephen Bavolek</h4>
        <p>It is my absolute pleasure to write some reference notes regarding working with you and the staff at Entryway in creating our new web site:
         </p>
         <div class="expandable">
         <ul class="bavolek">
           <li>1. I am impressed with the knowledge and talent of you and your staff. 
           </li>
           <li>2. You and your staff are current with the newest technology, very methodical in your work, work in controlled stages, plan ahead and work as a team.
             </li>
         <li>3. Creativity is necessary in your job and your team has it. Love the designs you create, offering me different models and different ways of looking at functions.
         </li>
         <li>4. You and your team are meticulous in your work.
         </li>
         <li>5. Pride is another factor. You are your staff take incredible pride in your work.
         </li>
         </ul>
         <p>6. Lastly, I would like to comment on how personable you are. You try in all ways to make sure you are capturing and incorporating my ideas into your design and functions. I have had experiences where I hired a firm to work with me in a creative project only to feel my views are secondary. There are two agendas with firms I have worked with in the past: the firm's agenda where the customer's comments and desires are secondary; and the customer's agenda where the firm trys in every way to create the product that the customer wants. The latter is Entryway. You work for the customer.

         <br/><br/>
         Others who read these thoughts hopefully glean from all this that I am 100% pleased with your work, our interactions, and know we will have a continuing working relationship for some time to come. Please know that perspective clients can call or e-mail me if they have specific questions.
         </p>
         <p>Sincerely,<br/>

      <h2>working with us</h2>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-process.png"/>
      <h3>Agile Process</h3>
      <p> We apply a <strong>flexible and evolving</strong> process to the practice of developing software. Your ideas may change when you start to see results and we want to support that. </p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-red_button.png"/>
      <h3>Short Iterations</h3>
      <p><strong>By breaking functioning releases into short, tight, and repeating iterations;</strong> the ability to support modifications is built into the process. Frequent, reviewable releases lead to a transparent view of the project's progress. </p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-new_mail.png"/>
      <h3>Open Communication</h3>
      <!-- content photo -->
      <p><strong>Whether it is a phone call, an email, or a staging site, you will know what's going on.</strong> We document your business scenerios with user stories to reduce the 'technical jargon' that can confuse and intimidate clients, so that we can easily communicate about features for the application. We use <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a> to prioritize and convey project status. </p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-security.png"/>
      <h3>Behavior-Driven Development</h3>
      <p><strong>To ensure reliability and focus, testing code goes hand in hand with writing code.</strong> We write verifiable specifications that ensure your application behavior is solid and reliable. Often specified tests will indicate a problem long before the user of your application is affected, allowing us to fix problems before they become 'problems'.</p>
      <img class="icon" alt="" src="../images/splash/icon-comments.png"/>
      <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
      <p>By coding together we keep each other <strong>focused and efficient</strong>.  We develop cleaner and stronger code by reviewing and refactoring together.  We find that pair programming not only aids in our productivity, it gives us a deeper understanding of our code base.</p>
