  <p  title="greenling"><strong>Greenling</strong> is one of those community benefactors. They want to change the world. Their mission: build sustainable communities by creating a support system for local small farmers, cutting energy expenditures, and delivering high quality organic foods to new customers daily. Not just local foods, <em>organic</em> foods that are herbicide and pesticide free, grown within 100 miles of you, and delivered fresh to your door on a regular basis. Greenling does more than carpool groceries. By helping small farms get their goods to nearby consumers almost the day they are picked, plucked, or pulled from the ground, Greenling supports local economies where <strong>'Small is Beautiful'</strong>. <a href="http://vimeo.com/1448616"> Watch a video about Greenling &gt;&gt;</a></p>
